## Project Overview
This report presents an analysis of a survey conducted by Kaggle in 2021 on states of Machine Learning and Data Science among tech industry professionals and students. The survey covers various aspects such as job roles, education levels, programming languages used, and machine learning methods employed. The analysis reveals significant insights into the current trends and patterns in the tech industry.

## Introduction
The tech industry is diverse and rapidly evolving. Understanding the trends and patterns in this industry can provide valuable insights for decision-making, whether for career development, academic research, or business strategy. This report aims to analyze the survey data to uncover these insights.

## Data Sources
The data used in this analysis is derived from a comprehensive survey[Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2021). The survey includes responses from a wide range of individuals in the tech industry, including students, software engineers, data scientists, and others. The survey data covers various aspects such as job roles, education levels, programming languages used, and machine learning methods employed.

## Analysis
The analysis was conducted using various data visualization tool (tableau) and visualization techniques, including bar charts and pie charts. These visualizations helped in understanding the distribution and trends in the data.

### Job Roles

The analysis of salary vaiation for different job roles shows  that Business Analysts, Data Scientists, and Database Engineers are among the highest paid roles, while Product Managers, Program/Project Managers, and Software Engineers are among the lowest paid roles.
## Interpretation and Discussion
The analysis reveals several key trends in the tech industry. The prevalence of Software Engineers and Students among the respondents suggests that these roles are common and potentially in high demand. The high level of education among respondents indicates the importance of formal education in this industry.

The popularity of Python and SQL suggests that these languages are essential tools in the tech industry, likely due to their versatility and wide range of applications. The popularity of the Linear or logistic Convolutional Neural Network and Decision Tree approaches in machine learning indicates that these methods are widely used and recognized in the field.

## Conclusion
The following is the conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis:
- The majority of respondents are either Software Engineers or Students, indicating these roles are common in the tech industry. On the other hand, roles like Data Scientist and Statistician are less common among the respondents.
- Python and SQL are popular programming languages in the tech industry, likely due to their versatility and wide range of applications. On the other hand, languages like Julia and Swift have fewer users, possibly because they are more specialized or less well-known.
- The majority of respondents have a bachelor’s degree or higher. This suggests that higher education is common among the respondents.
- Linear or Logistic reggression, Convolutional Neural Network and Decision Tree approaches are the most commonly used machine learning methods among the respondents. Other methods like Support Vector Machine, Generative Adversarial Network, and Gradient Boosting are less popular.
- There is a significant difference in the annual salaries of different job roles in the tech industry. Roles such as Business Analyst, Data Scientist, and Database Engineer tend to have higher salaries compared to roles like Product Manager, Program/Project Manager, and Software Engineer.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:
- If you’re considering learning a new programming language, Python and SQL could be good choices due to their popularity and broad usage. However, the best choice depends on your specific goals, interests, and the requirements of your projects or job role. It could also be beneficial to learn less common languages like Julia or Swift, as specialized skills can sometimes lead to unique opportunities.
- If you’re considering a career in the tech industry, Software Engineering could be a good field to explore given its popularity. However, less common roles like Data Scientist or Statistician could also offer unique opportunities. It’s important to consider your personal interests, skills, and career goals when choosing a job role.
-  For a more accurate representation of the population’s education level, the survey could be conducted on a larger and more diverse sample size. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the correlation between education level and other variables such as job role, salary, and use of machine learning methods.
- If you’re considering which machine learning method to use, you might want to start with the Convolutional Neural Network or Decision Tree approaches as they are widely used. However, the best choice depends on your specific use case and the nature of your data. It’s also important to keep learning and stay updated with the latest trends in machine learning methods.
- For individuals seeking high-paying jobs in the tech industry, they might consider roles such as Business Analyst, Data Scientist, or Database Engineer. However, it’s important to note that these roles may require specific skills and qualifications. It’s also crucial to consider job satisfaction, career growth, and personal interest when choosing a career path.

## Future Work
Further research could explore the correlation between these variables, such as the relationship between job role and programming language use, or education level and machine learning method preference.
